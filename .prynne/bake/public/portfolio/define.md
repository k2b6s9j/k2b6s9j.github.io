I created Define in 2012 after discovering [iOS 5 exposed a full dictionary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uireferencelibraryviewcontroller), but had no front-end to use it with. The application was designed after and inspired by [the Dictionary app built in to macOS](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software)>).
