# Raw Website Assets

This directory contains any of the raw assets that are not directly rendered on the site. This primarily includes images created for the site in their original vector form.

The folder is not considered when building the site using Gatsby.

## Starting from Vector

Vector images with a 1,600x1,600 and a strong center focus make for good center images.
