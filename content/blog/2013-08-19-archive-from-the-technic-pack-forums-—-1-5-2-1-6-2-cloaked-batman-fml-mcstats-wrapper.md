Below is an archive of the post announcing the release of version 1.0 of my Minecraft 1.5.2 & 1.6.2 mod cloaked batman on the Minecraft Forums on August 19, 2013. Because Minecraft Forums does not appear to show post edit histories version announcements there are sadly lost to time, making [version 1.0.2's announcement](/blog/2013-11-27-archive-from-minecraft-forums-—-1-6-x-fml-cloaked-batman-mod-statistics-publisher/) the only announcement on Minecraft Forums to be archived.

The content below was edited with correct URLs on July 29, 2019. The original post can be found on [The Technic Pack Forums](https://forums.technicpack.net/topic/49313-152162-cloaked-batman-fmlmcstats-wrapper/).
