Below is an archive of the post announcing the release of my Atom grammer for Minecraft Forge configuration files on the Minecraft Forums on July 10, 2015.

I've created a language grammar for the configuration files created by Minecraft Forge. This will allow you to open a config file in GitHub's Atom Editor with (mostly) full and complete syntax highlighting and section folding.

To Install:
- Download the [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/)
- Open your Settings
- Install a package called: `language-minecraft-forge-cfg`

And TaDah! You have a fully hackable text editor which enriches your Modded Minecraft Configuration experience. To see a screenshot of the editor in action check out the screenshot in the attachments of this post.

Enjoy!
