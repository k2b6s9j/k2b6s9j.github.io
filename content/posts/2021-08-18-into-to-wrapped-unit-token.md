This project is the inventory management portion of my project for Enterprise Resource Management and business process automation on the blockchain.

The Wrapped Unit Token (WUT) is the tokenized equivalent of the Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) used in traditional inventory management solutions. WUTs are represented on the Ethereum blockchain using [ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens, allowing WUT to represent inventoried assets of nearly any variety.

## Motivation

Using a blockchain with smart contract capabilities ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), etc.) for inventory management will allow for greater efficiency and transparency in businesses of any size and creating the opportunity of mitigating supply chain issues, such as [those caused globally by the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic).

## Advantages of Tokenizing Inventory Assets

Consumers, businesses, and governments would be able to gain insight to the stock capabilities of the sector they are working within (retail, manufacturing, food & beverage, etc.)

### WUT Advantages for Businesses

Businesses who manage their inventories using WUTs would maintain a verifiable log of all stock activity, linking all activity related to the sales and purchasing transactions responsible for change in inventory.

### WUT Advantages for Consumers

Consumers who transact an item represented by a WUT would be able to maintain a verifiable proof of purchase.

### WUT Advantages for Manufacturers

Manufacturers who maintain their output using WUTs would maintain the resources needed to create a WUT using other WUTs as input.
