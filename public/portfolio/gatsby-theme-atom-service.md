I created `gatsby-theme-atom-service` in 2019 while working on the [AtomBuild](/portfolio/atombuild-website) and [AtomLinter](/portfolio/atomlinter-website) websites. `gatsby-theme-atom-service` is a [Gatsby Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/) and allows organizations that create [Atom Services](https://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/interacting-with-other-packages-via-services/) to curate and display the packages within their ecosystem.

Below are three example of the theme in action:

## [In-Repo Test Site](https://github.com/keplersj/gatsby-theme-atom-service/tree/master/example)

This site exists in the same repository as the theme, and allows for experimentation on working site. The example site has the smallest configuration for the site work, and can be used as an example to guide anyone interested in using `gatbsy-theme-atom-service`.

Below is a screenshot of the site, as of December 31, 2019:

## [AtomBuild Website](https://atombuild.github.io/)

This is the website for the [AtomBuild organization](https://github.com/AtomBuild). Because [@noseglid](https://github.com/noseglid)'s [`atom-build`](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) uses a consumer-provider architecture similar to [AtomLinter](https://atomlinter.github.io), a webpage based on AtomLinter's was created to curate the packages within the `build` ecosystem.

For more on the development story of the AtomBuild website [see its entry on this portfolio](/portfolio/atombuild-website).

## [AtomLinter Website](https://atombuild.github.io/)

This is the website for the [AtomLinter organization](https://github.com/AtomLinter). The website was originally created to solve the problem users having difficulty finding Linters for Atom in 2015. In the years since the site has transitioned from being a Jekyll site built with Bootstrap, to a Gatsby site built with this theme.
